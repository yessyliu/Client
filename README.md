# Client
Create new menu client with insert, edit, delete, and view function

I am using vb6 and SQL Server 2014

- Source Code is in "Client" folder.
- You will find mini apps in "Application" folder, change config.txt to your connection string. I am using windows authentication login.
- Create new database server named "TestProject" and run the script in "Query" folder. If you don't want to create new database server, you need to change initial catalog in config.txt.
